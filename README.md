## 1. Game Concept

A browser-based, top-down mini-game inspired by Xerath's ultimate ability from League of Legends. The game includes survival and freeplay modes and introduces power-ups as the player progresses.

## 2. Game World

The game is set on Summoner's Rift, starting in the mid-lane. Future versions might include other environments like the jungle, dragon/baron pit, and other lanes.

## 3. Player Character

The player takes the role of Xerath, a champion from League of Legends. Xerath's ultimate ability, Arcane Barrage, is the main gameplay mechanic.

## 4. Game Modes

### 4.1 Survival Mode

In Survival Mode, the player has to survive waves of enemies. These waves increase in difficulty over time.

### 4.2 Freeplay Mode

Freeplay Mode is a relaxed game mode where enemies continuously respawn after they die.

## 5. Enemies

### 5.1 Lux

The initial enemy is Lux, a champion from League of Legends without a dash ability. The enemy moves randomly on the map.

### 5.2 Ezreal

For later levels, an enemy like Ezreal with a dash ability can be introduced for increased difficulty.

## 6. Interactions

### 6.1 Losing a Life

When an enemy reaches the player in Survival Mode, the player loses a life.

### 6.2 Defeating Enemies

When an enemy is defeated, they are eliminated from the map. In Freeplay mode, they respawn after a short time.

## 7. Scoring

Players score points for direct hits, combos, and their hit percentage. 

## 8. Power-ups

The non-Xerath player starts with a 'Flash' ability, which has a cooldown period. After passing a certain number of levels, players can buy a dash item as a power-up.

## 9. Progression System

In Survival Mode, the progression is based on surviving waves of enemies which increase in difficulty. In Freeplay Mode, the game continues indefinitely with enemies respawning continuously.

## 10. Future Enhancements

Enhancements for future versions might include different terrains, environments, more enemy types, and additional power-ups.
